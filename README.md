# Sales and Operations Planning Project with Python
This project simulates a Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process using the zero-stock level strategy. The S&OP process aims to balance demand and supply by aligning sales forecasting, demand planning, production planning, and inventory planning. In this project, we use Python to implement a simple S&OP process that asks the user to enter initial stock, the number of months to plan, and the planned sales quantity for each month.
